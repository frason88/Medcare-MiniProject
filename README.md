In todays time we see a lot of the shortage of the doctors in the world especially in India. A lot of people are suffering a lot without the help of the proper medical checkup. Mobile devices and apps provide many benefits for medical care professionals, perhaps most significantly increased access to point-of-care tools, which has been shown to support better clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes.

We have built this webapp "Medslife App" to help clinicians identify the appropriate scans or tests to order, decreasing unnecessary procedures and reducing cost of care. You can diagnose the following health conditions :

* Breast Cancer • Diabetes • Heart Condition • Liver Condition • Kidney Condition

# Data Selection
The datasets used for model development are available on kaggle.com

# Model Selection
To fit the data, the classification models that we wish to compare are Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forest Classifier. I have split the entire data frame into 80% Training Set and 20% Test set, where I hold out the Test Set for final model evaluation. Using the models with best score I have further deployed the app.

# Future Work
We can add some more disease in the app which requires image data of X-Ray like Covid, Pneumonia and so on.
